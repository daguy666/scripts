# packet_direction

I will document this a little better soon. 

Determine where traffic is going 
Use scapy to grab X amount of packets, get the protocol used, then do a geolookup on them.

```[+] Protocol: UDP  Source: 192.147.0.98 Location: US ==> Destination: 10.252.1.217 Location: Unregistered```
